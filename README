Important:
In the actual Linux-Kernels all interrupts are disabled during data-transfer
to or from an IDE/EIDE-harddisk. This will lead, even with a FIFO-16550, to
missing characters. Therefore the program 'hdparm' must be used to enable
the interrupts during data-transfers (parameter '-u 1' <device>).
