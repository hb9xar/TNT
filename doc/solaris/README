dptnt or simple tnt is a terminal packet radio programm.
you need a serial connection to a tnc with hostmode.
for example a tnc2 running thefirm. 
it's also possible to communicate with a kiss-tnc.
you have to run tfkiss as daemon. 

***
the solaris portation:
i took dptnt, which was written by mark wahl DL4YBG,
the latest version V1.3 by Jonny, DH3MB 
modifications ware made, so that the source 
code can be compiled on solaris. 
i use solaris 2.5.1 on sun sparc with 
gnu c-compiler 2.7.2 and should be also able to
compile on intel solaris without any modifications.
during compilation no warning occour.

to compile dptnt, you need gmake, the gnu-make, 
standard make doesn't work. do the following:
  cd src
  gmake dep 
  gmake 

i did some modifications on the keyboard setting, so 
look also at the tnt.hlp file here. 
some wrapper scripts should help you easy to start.
start with mtnt.
there is no install-script, you have to play around.

source code is availble from  ftp://ftp.bfl.at
