                Changes from V1.0 to V1.1alpha1 (Mark, DL4YBG)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implemented an interface to the Linux-Kernel-AX25. See file
ax25krnl.doc for details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Changes from V1.1alpha1 to V1.1alpha2 (Mark, DL4YBG)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TNT V1.1alpha1 did not compile with module-xx-patched 2.0.x-kernels or
2.1.x-kernels and the 2.1.22b-ax25-utilities.

Using V1.1alpha2 you can compile and use TNT. It was tested with Kernel
2.0.29 with module-12 and ax25-utilities 2.1.22b.

Thanks to Jonathan, G4KLX and Joerg, DL1BKE for patches. As Rose and Netrom
support needs some restructuring of the code, support for these will follow
later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Changes from V1.1alpha2 to V1.1alpha3 (Mark, DL4YBG)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some problems, which were found using V1.1alpha2 are now fixed:

- Using TNT command 'QRG' to modify the port data leads to corruption
  of the listen structure. Now only the display of the data is allowed,
  data is fetched on startup like before from /etc/ax25/axports.
- It was not possible to get data from a connected DPBox (only a few frames
  were sent, then no data flow anymore). Some status information about the
  connection was not given to DPBox.
- Using 'XCONNECT' leads to a corruption of the listen structure.
- Changing the callsign on channel 0 (unproto channel) leads to a corruption
  of the listen structure and did not work correctly.
  Now changing the callsign on channel 0 with 'I' will only update the
  unproto source callsign. If you use 'MYCALL' on channel 0, the callsigns
  of all channels will be changed.

                Changes From V1.1alpha3 to V1.1alpha13 (Matthias, WS1LS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I build in many features known from other Packet-Programms. For additional
information take a look in ../.others/README.

- correction of the MD2-password creation, for using with dpbox.
- build in new remote-command "//act" for showing the last sysop-activity.
- statusinformation in rx and tx-file transfer got additional information,
  like remaining time.
- build in new remote-command "//session" to show lifetime of TNT.
- create new macros to complete the new remotecommands:
  %a shows last sysopactivity.
  %s shows lifetime of TNT.
  %m prints a message, which can be set using ":MSG" command
- build in new console-command ":TELL" to send a message to all connected
  stations.
  NOTE: this command and similar commands, use the "routes.tnt" file, to
        get information about the type of station. To avoid sending any things
        to a node or a box, please put "N>..." or "B>..." into your routes.tnt.
        There is also an additional feature: remotecommands in boxmails or
        coming from a node, won't be executed, if there is an entry like
        "N>..." or "B>..." in your routes.tnt.
- build in new console-commands ":DA", ":WEG", ":600", ":KLO" and ":GND".
  this commands have the same feature like in other packet-prgs (STOP or XP
  for example).
  this commands will send special information, depending on the content of
  a config file, named "telltexte.tnt".
  You can put there two informations for each of the console-commands.
  the first is a text which will be send to each connected station.
  the second is the text, which will be copied to the %m-macro.
  (Of course you can avoid to set the macro or to send a text to the connected
  stations, just take a look at the example-file).
- there a macros which you can use for (and only for) sending informations to
  all connected stations. these macros you can use in the ":TELL" command and
  in the telltexte-config file (but here only for the text to all stations, not
  for the macro-text).
  %n: will print your name
  %c: will print your callsign
  %k: will print the channelnr.
  %t: will print the actual time
  %g: will print the control-character $07 for a bell.
  %b: same as %g
- user defined quit-text. (with additional macro %l for showing connecttime).
- in order to this, there are now the two remote-commands "//q" which will
  send the quit-text and then disconnect, and "//d" which will disconnect
  immediately without sending a quit-text.
- build in new remote-command "//onactivity" to set a special text, which will
  be send, if there is any sysopactivty. (sysops, be careful now ;-)
- build in new switch ":RXBELL" to kill noisy bells while receiving a file.
- build in chat commands. You can now chat using the normal syntax "//n ..."
  addition syntax is using "//msg <call> <text>" to send a text to a connect
  station, without knowing the channel-number.
- TNT got soundeffects. You now can hear special songs for different
  situations, like connect, disconnects, link failure, //ring, etc.
  just take a look at sounds.tnt.
- changed apperance of lower statusline, to show connected stations.
- build in new remote-command "//mh" to show a list of heard stations.
  (Of course you can use additional parameter, like a number to show only
  a count of entrys, or a searchpattern to show only special entrys).
- fd_struct patch.
- build an install-script to set up an easy installation on systems with
  dialog-package installed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Changes from V1.1alpha13 to V1.2 (Jonny, DH3MB)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more than one and a half year, no new patches or versions appeared from
Mark, so I decided to apply the last two patches from him and also some
patches from me which provide some new features:

- Due to a change in /usr/include/linux/posix_types.h beginning with
  Linux Kernel 2.0.32, all appearences of 'struct fd_set' had to be
  changed to 'fd_set'. This means that you need Kernel 2.0.32 or
  later if you want to compile TNT, or you have to undo these changes.
- TNT did not compile under glibc2 (aka libc6). The #include's had
  to be changed, so it will now compile with both libc5 and libc6.
- The configurationfile ~/tnt.ini now may also be named ~/.tntrc.
- Support for Linux-Kernel-AX.25 will be compiled in per default,
  the ax25-utils-include-files must reside in /usr/include/ax25.
- When using Kernel-AX.25, a new parameter named 'moni_socket'
  may be given in ~/.tntrc. TNT will then not try to open a monitor-socket
  (which requires root-privileges), but it will read the monitor
  from the given socket. E.g. if tnt sees the line 'moni_socket *:1234'
  in ~/.tntrc, it will read the monitor from a local interet-socket on
  port 1234.
- New remote-command: Using '//MSG <channel-number>' a QSO partner
  is now able to send a message to an other channel. The command
  may be abbreviated: '//<channel-number>' works, too. Switch
  of this feature using ':SETACC MSG OFF', if you don't like it.
  (WS1LS: please notice the changes from alpha3 to alpha13)
- New command: Using '://<remote-command>' you are able to force the
  execution of a remote command.
- New command: Using ':CTRLTX <character>' you are able to send a
  control-character. E.g. use ':CTRLTX T' to terminate a telnet-connection
  on some NOS-systems.
- Changed the behavior of automatically generating answers when a
  BayCom-password-request is received: When connecting to a callsign which
  has an BayCom-password-entry in pw.tnt, the first 20 lines, which are
  received from this call, are scanned for a password-request and - if
  a request has been found - the correct answer will be sent back. This
  is useful for answering a user-password-request of a BayCom-Mailbox.
  However, new versions of the FlexNet node use the
  BayCom-password-procedure. Now, if you receive the response of the
  FlexNet-PAR-command within the first 20 lines after connecting a FlexNet
  node, the lines are interpreted as a password-request and the according
  answer is sent back, which does not make sense, of course.
  The reason for this misinterpretation is the algorithm for finding
  such password-request: Every line is scanned for five numbers
  seperated by one or more spaces, and the FlexNet-parameter-list
  includes such lines. Due to this the algorithm has been changed: A
  line will only be interpreted as a password-request, if it additionally  
  includes the '>'-sign (Usually, password-requests look liks this:
  'DB0IRS> 1 2 3 4 5').
- When sending a file (either using the commands :SEND, :SENDABIN, etc. or
  after receiving //SEND, //SENDABIN, etc.) the specified file will now
  not only be searched in the upload-direcotry, but in the following ones
  (in the given order): upload-directory, download-directory,
  home-directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Changes from V1.1alpha13 to V1.2 (Matthias, WS1LS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- fixed order of mh-list output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Changes from V1.2 to V1.3 (Jonny, DH3MB)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug when sending a file using AutoBIN, which is not in the
  upload_directory.
- Cleaned up the "#ifdef __GLIBC__" stuff
- Sending empty lines is now possible, also with :WHOLELIN switched ON
- German umlauts are now sent with ISO encoding
- Rewrote the hufmann-decompression-procedure, so that uncompressed
  frames are recognized when :COMP is switched ON
- Hufmann-encoded frames will be decoded in the monitor window, if
  'moni_decomp' is set to '1' in tnt.ini; please note that this may
  fail sometimes, so that frames will be decoded although the are not
  really encoded
- Included a patch from Walter, DG9EP, which adds some new commands
  to include some PGP functionality:

  :PGPAUTO ON/OFF      Disables/enables the PGP functionality
                       Default: OFF

  :USEGPG              Use GPG instead of PGP
                       Default: OFF

  :PGPKEYAD ON/OFF     If enabled, received keys are added to the keyring
                       automatically; if disabled, the keys are shown only
                       Default: ON

  :PGPEDIT <password>  Calls an external editor set via the environment
                       variable EDITOR, or vi, if this is not provided.
                       The file name is generated by TNT. If you
                       save the file and exit the editor, TNT will
                       automatically add the PGP-signature and
                       send the file on the channel you entered the command,
                       so be sure to enter a SEND-command at the BBS before
                       you call the editor. Example:
                         SEND DEBATE @ WW  Do not use PGP!
                         :PGPEDIT <mypassword>
                         ^Z
                       If you exit the editor without saving the text, or
                       if you have provided the wrong password, nothing
                       will be sent.
                       In the second case, you may reenter the command with
                       the correct password and the edited text will be loaded
                       into the editor again.

  :GPGEDIT <password>  Same as PGPEDIT, but using GnuPG(GPG)

  Note: You need a working PGP 2.6.x installed on your system!
        The PGP support is still experimental and there are some
        problems left:
          - If :LOGQSO is active, the PGP functions will not work. However
            this is also true with features like :AUTO7P, and a general
            problem of TNT.
          - Files created with :PGPEDIT will not be deleted from the
            /tmp direcotry after they are sent.
       Please report bugs regarding the PGP stuff to DG9EP@DB0IZ.#NRW.DEU.EU
